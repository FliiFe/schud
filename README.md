# SCHUD

A Steam Controller HUD Ã -la-[VSCView](https://github.com/Nielk1/VSCView/), but for Linux.

All buttons now show. Test release includes packaged binaries. Should work on any distribution, though I have only tested on Solus.

To run:
1. Download "schud-linux-x64.zip" from releases. 
2. Unzip "schud-linux-x64.zip"
3. Run the "schud" file (double click, or right click -> open file, or `./schud` in terminal).
